<h2 class="header" id="about">About Me</h2>
  <p>As a student on the pre-law track at the University of Miami, I am interested in pursuing corporate law. My current studies have put me on track to understanding the importance of different communication methods within organizations, as well as how communications and public presentation work hand in hand towards comprehending the characteristics of business law. My previous internships have allowed me to familiarize myself with industries that I otherwise would have known little about, and have clarified for me my strong desire to practice law after university. </p>
